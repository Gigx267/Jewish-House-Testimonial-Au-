                            Thanks. let me be revealing. I entered workshop going “ho hum” and Karen won me over
                            with clarity, with utility, with intelligence with value. Karen has got me thinking beyond.
                            Thanks for the connection. You are calming me and offering value and needed assistance

interview nerves. I felt more confident in answering the questions that I didn’t prepare for as
well. Karen was wonderful, especially the interview sessions and she sent me the breathing
techniques exercise to help with my nervousness. It was a great experience.
With regards,

                            I really appreciate the fact that Jewish House has backed such a wonderful initiative. As you
                            can probably imagine, job finding, especially in a tough competitive market, and especially
                            being in the over 50&#39;s market, has not been an easy task in all aspects. To have a team that
                            can work together with wonderful facilitators, has meant that I felt I was not alone, able to
                            share some of my personal hurdles and have a safe space to discuss challenges or ways of
                            dealing with the current state. 
                            Each session was well structured and delivered, encouraging audience participation and
                            shares, as well as giving some really great tools to work with.
                            Many thanks,

                            Karen is amazing and takes an executive approach to marketing your personal brand (CV,
                            cover letter, LinkedIn profile). Her workshops and approach are distinctly different to what I
                            experienced in the MBA program in Melbourne. I feel that these workshops address core
                            changes and needs.
